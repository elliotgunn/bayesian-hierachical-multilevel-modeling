### What is Bayesian GLM?

Why?
- the priors regularize Bayesian estimates and thus avoid overfitting
    - regularization avoids overfitting (reduces variance by increasing bias); it introduces additional information (priors), thus constraining an estimation procedure
- shrinkage also helps to reduce overfitting
